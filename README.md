# Machine-Learning-on-Digits-Dataset

## Description:
This project showcases the application of various machine learning models on the Digits dataset. The Digits dataset is a popular dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of grayscale images of hand-drawn digits ranging from 0 to 9. The aim of this project is to explore different models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate their performance on the Digits dataset.

## Aim:
The aim of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning models on the Digits dataset and identify the best model for digit classification. The project explores the following models:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

For each model, the project includes steps such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation on test data, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. The project aims to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and identify the model that achieves the highest accuracy for digit classification.

## Conclusion:
After thorough experimentation and evaluation, the project concludes that the best model for the Digits dataset is the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. The KNN model achieved an accuracy score of 96%, outperforming the other models tested. The project demonstrates the importance of selecting an appropriate model for a specific dataset and the effectiveness of KNN for digit classification.
